<a name='top'>Combined analysis of Fucci fluorescence and cDNA concentration</a>
===============================================================================

Summary
-------

After [visual inspection](#no-cell_fluorescence), chambers with no cells or
with defect in the imaging were flagged for removal. The [DNA
yield](#no-cell_DNA-yield) for the same chambers was also very low.
Conversely, in the absence of cells, the proportion of
[spikes](#no-cell_spikes) was highest. This confirms the accuracy of the
visual inspection and confirms that the conversion between C1 chip coordinates
and 96-well plate coordinates was done correctly.

In the output file `combined.csv`, a column called `Discard` indicates if the
cell fails any of the quality controls.

Datasets
--------

 - The non corrected fluorescence values are produced as explained in
   [Fluorescence-measured-in-ImageJ.html](fluorescence/Fluorescence-measured-in-ImageJ.html).
 - The background and batch effect correction of the fluorescence values is explained 
   in [BackgroundCorrection.html](Intensity_correction/BackgroundCorrection.html)
 - The cDNA concentration values are produced as explained in
   [cDNA_concentration.html](cDNA_concentration/concentration_QC.html).
 - Normalised spike counts: `control-sequences/spikes.norm.csv`, see [control-sequences.html](control-sequences/control-sequences.html).
 - Location of the positive and negative controls: `controls.csv`, as indicated
   by the operators T. K., (email on Mon, 24 Mar 2014 20:06:36 +0900) and
   S. K. (e-mail on Tue, 25 Mar 2014 09:02:50 +0900).

Quality control
---------------

```{r message=FALSE}
library(gdata)   # for drop.levels()
library(ggplot2) # for the plots
library(scales)  # for trans_new()
```

### Load and merge the fluorescence and concentration values

The `qc` table is assembled by merging multiple data sources.  It is then saved
as `qc.full`.  In the steps that follow, entries that do not pass quality
controls will be removed from the `qc` table.

```{r qc-merging}
fl <- read.csv("../fluorescence/Results_fluorescence.csv")
fl$Error <- factor(fl$Error)
fl <- fl[,c(1,28,30,31,32,5,12,17,24)]

correctedFl <- read.csv('../Intensity_correction/correctedIntensities.csv')
correctedFl <- correctedFl[,c(1,9,10)]

qc <- merge(fl, correctedFl, by='cell_id', all=TRUE)

# pg as short name for picogreen
pg <- read.csv('../cDNA_concentration/cDNA_concentration.csv')
pg$Column <- factor(pg$Column)
pg$cell_id <- paste(pg$Run, pg$Well, sep='_')
qc <- merge(pg, qc, by=c('cell_id', 'Run', 'Well'), all=TRUE)

spikes <- read.csv('../control-sequences/spikes.norm.csv')
qc <- merge(qc, spikes, all=TRUE)

controls <- read.csv('../combine_all/controls.csv')
summary(controls)
controls$cell_id <- paste(controls$Run, controls$Well, sep='_')
qc <- merge(qc, controls, by=c('cell_id', 'Run', 'Well'), all=TRUE)
rownames(qc) <- qc$cell_id

hiseq <- read.csv('../HiSeq/HiSeq.csv')
hiseq <- hiseq[,c(1,10, 15:17,19,20)]
qc <- merge(qc, hiseq, by=c('cell_id', 'Run', 'Well', 'Row', 'Column'))

# replace error type with numbers
error <- sapply(strsplit(as.character(qc$Error),"-", fixed = TRUE),"[[", 1)
qc$Error <- error
  
qc.full <- qc

```

### Remove the samples that were replaced by positive or negative controls.

```{r}
qc <- subset(qc, is.na(qc$Control))
```

### Visual curation

Visual curation of the fluorescence pictures (`Error` field, see
[Fluorescence-measured-in-ImageJ.html](fluorescence/Fluorescence-measured-in-ImageJ.html)) eliminated the chambers
where it was not sure wether a healthy single cell was captured, in good concordance with the DNA yields.
In the absence of a cell the libraries are mostly made of spikes.

```

### Median DNA yield

The DNA yield of chambers with no cells varies from run to run.  Note that all
chambers contain spikes, so the yield will not be null.

```{r}
yield <- with(subset(qc, as.character(Error) < 2), tapply(Concentration, list(Run, drop.levels(Error)), median))
colnames(yield) <- c('one cell', 'no cell')
yield
```

### Removing chambers which failed fluorescence QC

```{r}
qc <- subset(qc, fluo_QC != TRUE,)
summary(qc)
```

### Removing chambers which were affected by pipetting errors.

The libraries with pipetting errors failed the [HiSeq QC](HiSeq/HiSeq.html).

```{r}
qc <- subset(qc, HiSeq_QC == TRUE)
```

### Removing low-complexity libraries.

Some libraries in run 1772-067-039 are outliers with low yield, no fluorescence and higher proportion
of low-complexity reads, therefore we remove them.

```{r}
summary(subset(qc, low.complexity > 9000 & Run == '1772-067-039'))
qc <- subset(qc, ! (low.complexity > 9000 & Run == '1772-067-039'))
```

Two libraries 1772-067-038 have quantities of spikes that are way higher than
the average, suggesting bad quality.  It is not sure whether they should be
removed from the final analysis, but removing them now helps the readability of
the plots below.

```{r}
#  Disabled: removing them causes one of the plots to crash due to problems on guessing the scale.
#subset(qc, Run == '1772-067-038' & SPIKE_1 > 1)
#summary(subset(qc, Run == '1772-067-038' & SPIKE_1 < 1, SPIKE_1))
#qc <- subset(qc, ! (Run == '1772-067-038' & SPIKE_1 > 1))
```

### There is an inverse correlation between the quantity of spike reads and the DNA yield.

If the spikes provide _S_ molcules and the cells provide _C_ molecules, then
the spike ration should be _S / (S − C)_, which also equals to _1 − C / (S +
C)_.  In addition, the DNA yield should be proportional to the total number of
molecules, _S + C_.  Therefore, the spike ratio, aproximated by the `SPIKE_1`
value, has an inverse relationship with the DNA yield, measured by the
`Concentration` value.

```{r concentration_spike1, dev=c('svg', 'png')}
ggplot(
  data=qc,
  aes(Concentration, SPIKE_1)) + 
  geom_point() + facet_wrap('Run', scale='free') + stat_quantile(formula='y ~ x')

#ggplot(
#  data=qc,
#  aes(Concentration, SPIKE_1)) + 
#  geom_point() + facet_wrap('Run', scale='free') + stat_quantile(formula='y ~ x') + 
#  scale_x_continuous(trans = trans_new('inverse', transform = function(x) 1 / x, inverse = function(x) 1 / x), name='concentration (inverse scale)')

ggplot(
  data=qc,
  aes(
    ave(qc$Concentration, qc$Run, FUN = function(X) {rank(X) / length(X)}),
    ave(qc$SPIKE_1, qc$Run, FUN = function(X) {rank(X) / length(X)}))) + 
  geom_point()  + facet_wrap('Run') + stat_quantile(formula='y ~ x') +
  scale_x_continuous(name="rank/length concentration") +
  scale_y_continuous(name="rank/length SPIKE_1")
```

### Relation between fluorescence intensity and DNA concentration.


```{r pairwiseplot, dev=c('svg', 'png')}
with(qc,
  plot(
    data.frame(
      logCh2Corrected = log(ch2_corrected + 1),
      logCh3Corrected = log(ch3_corrected + 1),
      Concentration, low.complexity, SPIKE_1, HPV), col=Run))
```
``` {r concentration_logCh3_corrected, dev=c('svg', 'png')}
ggplot(data=qc, aes(Concentration, log(ch3_corrected))) + geom_point() + facet_wrap('Run', scale='free')
```

### Add a global QC flag and export the full table

```{r}
qc.full$Discard <- FALSE
qc.full[ !is.na(qc.full$Control), 'Discard'] <- TRUE
qc.full[ is.na(qc.full$fluo_QC), 'Discard'] <- TRUE
qc.full[ which(qc.full$fluo_QC == TRUE), 'Discard'] <- TRUE
qc.full[ !qc.full$HiSeq_QC, 'Discard'] <- TRUE

write.csv(qc.full, file='../combine_all/combined.csv', row.names=FALSE)
```
